# django-test-newspaper-app
I made this Django Newspaper app while read "Django for beginners. Build websites with Python&amp;Django" by William S. Vincent


Newspaper app has:
- articles app with CRUD functionality
- robust user authentication flow including the use of email for password resets
- added custom user model ( for adding additional fields)
- added an additional Comment model
